# MOST: Modern Open Scientific / Standard Templates
_The nearest star is 4.25 light-years from Earth which is why MOST wishes take at least 9 years to come true_ :) Nevertheless, we are searching for the *MOST*!


## ÙŽAbout
Welcome to __Modern Open Scientific / Standard Templates (MOST)__ repository. By submitting my M.Sc. thesis in 2018, I introduced a new latex template to perform writing and publishing **Persian thesis** in a standard and pretty style. 
Now, this repository consists of additional latex and Microsoft Office templates, including templates for technical reports, homework, and presentations. We decided to publish all of these templates on GitHub. 
Please send me your feedback and comments if you are using (Z)MOST templates.  


## Philosophy
Doing something is important, but delivering it is more important.
Fork the MOST and deliver *most* of the things that your audiences need!
