Welcome to __Modern Open Scientific / Standard Templates (MOST)__ repository. By submitting my MSc thesis in 2018, I introduced a new latex template to perform writing and publishing Persian thesis in a standard and pretty style. 
Today this repository consists of additional latex and Microsoft office template including templates for technical reports, homework, and presentations. We decided to publish all of these templates on GitHub. 
Please send me your feedback and comments if you are using this template.
